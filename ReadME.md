# Quantum Internship Data Science
# Task 3 - Regression on tabular data

* The train dataset (internship_train.csv) contains 53 anonymized features and a target column.

* The jupyter notebook file (Task3-Data-Analysis.ipynb) contains the analysis of the dataset.

* The analysis was followed by regression using two methods: Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor

* Target metric is Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) 

* The best RMSE value obtained for the developed Decision Tree Regressor model is equal to 0.0077

* model.py file contains code for the best developed model and generates the result file for the test dataset

* model_predictions.csv file contains predicted target values for the test dataset 

* requirements.txt file contains all used libraries
